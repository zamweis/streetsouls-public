# Streetsouls Website - Alpha Version

This repository serves as a demonstration of my early experience and capabilities in web development using various technologies. Originally created as my first attempt to build a website many years ago, this project represents the foundation of my learning journey in web development. It showcases an alpha version of a web platform that is under active development and primarily intended as a proof-of-concept.

Please note that several components and features, including a custom-built minimal CMS, have been intentionally omitted from this repository due to security and privacy considerations.

## Project Overview

The **Streetsouls Website** project was initially developed as a personal exercise to explore different web technologies and frameworks. While it served as a valuable learning experience, the current version is more focused on demonstrating technical proficiency rather than delivering a fully functional product. This project highlights my familiarity with both front-end and back-end development.

### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Illustrate my experience in building websites and web applications.
- Showcase my knowledge of various coding languages, frameworks, and libraries.
- Serve as an example of the development process I employ for creating scalable and maintainable code.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages a variety of technologies, including both front-end and back-end tools. Below is a breakdown of the key technologies and languages used in this repository:

### Front-End Technologies

- **HTML5:** Provides the structure and layout for the web pages, utilizing semantic elements to enhance accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS3 & SASS:** Enables the creation of responsive and visually appealing designs with modern layout techniques (e.g., Flexbox and Grid). SASS is used to write more modular and maintainable stylesheets.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Implements dynamic interactions and logic on the client-side, making the website more engaging and responsive to user actions.
- **jQuery:** Simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling, providing quick solutions for building interactive elements.
- **Bootstrap:** Utilized as a CSS framework to streamline the creation of responsive layouts and components.

### Back-End Technologies

- **PHP:** Handles server-side scripting and logic. PHP is used to process form submissions, interact with the database, and render dynamic content.
- **MySQL/MariaDB:** Acts as the database layer to store and retrieve data. This includes user information, content, and metadata.
- **JSON:** Used for configuration files and data transfer between the server and client, facilitating structured and lightweight data handling.

### Additional Tools & Libraries

- **Photoswipe & Justified Gallery:** JavaScript libraries for creating dynamic image galleries with smooth transitions and responsive layouts.
- **FontAwesome & Custom Icons:** Provides a wide variety of icons for UI elements, enhancing the visual appeal and usability.
- **Gulp:** Automates tasks like CSS pre-processing, image optimization, and JavaScript minification, improving overall development workflow and performance.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the website, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP files.
  - **`assets/`**: Holds all static assets such as images, icons, and fonts.
  - **`js/`**: Includes custom JavaScript files and external libraries.
  - **`css/`**: Contains SASS and CSS stylesheets.
  - **`templates/`**: PHP templates for different sections of the website.
  - **`text/`**: JSON files for configuration and content management.
- **`images/`**: Stores all image assets, organized into various categories (e.g., design, icons, team).

## Known Issues & Limitations

- The project is in its early stages, so several features are either incomplete or not functional.
- Backend functionality is currently limited to basic PHP and database interactions.
